# Stella

**Stella** is a software written in Rust that finds *prime k-tuplets* (also called *prime constellations*). For now, it is just an inefficient prototype with very few features. It is currently provided as an experimental Rust Crate; we will assume that you are already familiar with this programming language.

One of it's goals is to become usable for Riecoin mining and possibly succeed [rieMiner](https://riecoin.dev/en/rieMiner) (Stella can be seen as a Rust port of rieMiner), and to break world records. Even if the Rust implementation were to remain less efficient, the improved code readability may help to try new optimizations that could then be implemented and ported back to rieMiner.

Another goal would be to help Riecoin and number crunching developers that are interested in understanding how the mining algorithm works. rieMiner is the merge and heavy refactor of previous Riecoin miners, and carries years of history, which can make the understanding of its code difficult, especially with the fact that documentation and explanations by previous developers are basically nonexistent. Stella is written from scratch and in a more modular way, which can greatly help the learning process for future developers.

## Stella Crate Usage

Since this is a prototype software, a lot of the usage instructions is subject to change in the future.

The Stella interface relies on the Rug's Integer structure, so add the following to your `Cargo.toml` in order to use the Crate:

```
rug = "^1.19.0"
stella = "0.0.2"
```

Optionally, you can use the following imports in your source files, we will assume that you did that below.

```
use rug::Integer;
use stella::Stella;
```

### Stella Instance

A `Stella` instance will handle the customizable search of Prime Constellations, create it with

```
let mut stella = Stella::new();
```

### Parameters

Now, the instance must be configured via a struct called `Params`, using the `set_params` method. Here are the fields of this structure:

* `workers: usize`: number of workers to use for the search. Set this to `0` to autodetect the number of threads in your machine;
* `constellation_pattern: Vec<isize>`: which sort of constellations to look for, as (cumulative) offsets separated by commas. Set this to an empty Vector to use the default pattern `0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 18, 20`;
* `target: Integer`: sets the target as a Rug Integer, the prime constellation search will start at this number. Set this to `0` to use the default target of 2^1024;
* `prime_table_limit`: the prime table used for searching prime constellations will contain primes up to the given number. Set this to `0` to use the default limit of `16777216`;
* `primorial_number`: the Primorial Number for the sieve process. Higher is better, but for practical reasons it should be such that the actual primorial is a bit smaller than the target. Set this to `0` to use the default value of `120`;
* `primorial_offset`: the offset from a primorial multiple to use for the sieve process. Set this `0` to choose automatically a hardcoded one associated to the pattern;
* `sieve_size`: the size of the primorial factors table for the sieve in bits. It will be rounded up to the next multiple of the machine's word size if needed. Set this to `0` to use the default size of 2^25;

Here is an example of a configuration of the Stella instance,

```
stella.set_params(stella::Params {
	workers: 8,
	constellation_pattern: vec![0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 18, 20, 26],
	prime_table_limit: 10000000,
	primorial_number: 20,
	primorial_offset: 380284918609481,
	target: Integer::from(1) << 128,
	sieve_size: 10000000
});
```

### Initialization

Once proper parameters have been set with `set_params`, the Stella instance must be initialized with

```
stella.init();
```

### Starting Workers

Actual number crunching can now be started with

```
stella.start_workers();
```

This launches detached worker threads that will look for prime constellations as configured above. Since the workers are detached threads, a main thread must also be run by the library user. In order to view statistics and handle results found by the Stella instance, read the sections below.

### Stats

Once the Stella instance is initialized, you can access some relevant statistics with the `stats` method. It contains the following fields:

* `prime_table_size: usize`: number of prime numbers in the prime table;
* `prime_table_generation_time: f64`: how much time in s it took to generate this prime table;
* `modular_inverses_generation_time: f64`: how much time in s it took to generate the modular inverses table;
* `search_start_instant: Instant`: the instant when the workers were launched;
* `sieving_duration: f64`: the CPU time in s spent for sieving;
* `candidates_generated: usize`: how many candidates were generated during that time;
* `testing_duration: f64`: the CPU time in s spent for testing candidates;
* `tuple_counts: Vec<usize>`: how many tuples were found (the index is the tuple length associated to the count).

### Outputs

When a result of interest is found by the Stella instance (actual prime k-tuplet, long enough tuple, or pool share depending on the use case and configuration), it is internally pushed to a queue. Using the `pop_output` methode, you can retrieve an output from the queue and "consume" it. It is presented as an `Output` structure containing the following fields:

* `n: Integer`: the base number of the tuple;
* `k: usize`: can represent the number of consecutive primes starting from the first number, or something else depending on how the instance was configured (like the Share Prime Count in Pooled Mining);
* `constellation_pattern: Vec<isize>`: with which pattern this result is associated;
* `worker_id: usize`: the internal id of the worker that found the result.

### Example Program

An example program is provided in the GitHub repository and may be ran in the following way.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pttn/Stella.git
cd Stella
cargo build --release
```

You can inspect the `main.rs` source file to see a concrete example of the use of the Stella Crate.
